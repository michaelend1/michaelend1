## About me

I'm a Networking and Cybersecurity graduate with a strong passion for technology, hands-on problem solving, and building secure systems. I completed my A.A.S. in Networking & Cybersecurity at Finger Lakes Community College, and I’m continuing my education at the University at Albany majoring in Cybersecurity.

I enjoy working with real systems, breaking things, fixing them, and understanding how networks and security tools operate in practice.

## My Goal

To become a Cybersecurity professional and understand threats, prevent attacks, and keep an organizations data safe in order to operate without fear.
